# Utils

Shortcuts and command hacks of some of the tasks I perform. These are short notes to help incase I forget about usage of some of my tools. I do not have to go over the tools documentation, I can quickly access them here, because I already know what I want.

The commands are written in a way that best suits my usecases. I will keep updating the list over time. The list mostly contains notes to the tools that I forgot about often, maybe because I don't use them everyday. In case I learn about a new tool, I will try update the list first.
